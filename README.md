Timely and targeted content generation is essential to yield desired marketing results for any
business. This is carried through higher user engagement which in turn drives sales and broader
customer outreach. Scoring high on user engagement KPIs boosts brand credibility,reach and
productrecall.
This also helps marketers strengthen on algorithmic favorability which for a social media company
decides on the post that gets propelled based on the engagement it drives.

## Problem Description
The process of communication is defined by marketing researchers as below:
A receiver, upon receiving a message from a sender over a channel, interacts with the
message, thereby generating effects (user behavior). Any message is created to serve an end
goal. For a marketer, the eventual goal is to get the desired effect (user behavior) i.e. such as
likes, comments, shares and purchases, etc.

In this challenge, you will try to solve the problem of behavior simulation (Task-1) and content
simulation (Task-2), thereby helping marketers to estimate user engagement on their social
media content as well as create content that elicits the desired key performance indicators (KPI)
from the audience.
